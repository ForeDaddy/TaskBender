There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Task Bender

> Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

## Put your todo's on your calendar today

> Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

## Summary

> Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
> Task Bender is a web application that combines a todo list with your calendar in a drag and drop interface.

## Problem

> Describe the problem your product solves.
> There are many different approaches to productivity. We have our todo lists and we have our calendars. Historically these have been two separate systems that often try to manage the same things. It becomes challenging to manage our events (calendar, time-based items) with out todo's (task, not inherently time based) when we confuse the difference in our systems.

## Solution

> Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
> Task Bender solves this core productivity challenge by allowing you to add time-scoped todo items dynamically to your calendar. This system works with the pomodoro method, GTD system, and other popular productivity frameworks. We recommend starting your day by dragging your most important todo items directly to your available calendar slots each morning. The daily flexibilty with this planning method has proven to increase productivity and adherence to task completion over time-blocking.

## Quote from You

> A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
> "Get more done by spending time doing the tasks in your todo list. We developed Task Bender to help users focus thier time on what's important to them" - Task Bender Founder

## How to Get Started

> Describe how easy it is to get started.
> To get started, run the Task Bender App right from your browser. Add your tasks then drag them onto your daily calendar.

## Customer Quote

> Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
> "I've tried all sorts of time management systems over the years, but even with extreme discipline, sticking to a time-blocked calendar after the first few weeks always failed. Now I block my time with actual todo items! My productivity is practical and no longer aspirational." -- Business Owner and Task Bender User

## Closing and Call to Action

> Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
> Put Task Bender to work in your productivity system today. Experience the freedom and flexibility of time boxing with actual tasks.
